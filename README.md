# File-Explorer-using-Swing
 The code is a simple file explorer using Java Swing. It displays files and folders in the user's home directory. When a file is selected, its content is shown in a read-only text area. The interface has a clean and modern look with the NimbusLookAndFeel. It allows users to navigate directories and read file content easily.
